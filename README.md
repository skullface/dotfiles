These dotfiles were written for my own setup and workflows for personal and professional computing. You’re welcome to use them however works best for you, but I won’t accept issues/PRs for customizations.

## How to use

1. Clone this repo and navigate to it
2. Run the custom install script: `$ ./install.sh`
3. Replace local `.zshrc` with this repo’s `.zshrc`
4. Enjoy! 💕

## Details

Included in the install script:

- Oh My Zsh + [Spaceship prompt](https://github.com/spaceship-prompt/spaceship-prompt)
- MacOS customizations
- Helpful CLI tools and programs
- “CommitMonoSkull Nerd Font”, a customized version of [Commit Mono](https://commitmono.com) ([test drive](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#commit-mono)) patched via [NerdFonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)
- [Aliases](https://github.com/skullface/dotfiles/tree/main/aliases) for my most-used (or most-forgotten) commands and functions

#### Terminal profiles/themes

- Ghostty: `terminal/ghostty` 🌟
- Warp: `terminal/warp` 🪦
- iTerm2: `terminal/Cassette.json` with [Hardcore](https://github.com/hardcore/iTerm-colors/blob/master/hardcore.itermcolors) color scheme 🪦
- Terminal: `terminal/Cassette.terminal` 🪦

#### Cursor/VS Code settings

I use Settings Sync to take care of this, but a backup lives in `vscode/settings.json` 🤞
